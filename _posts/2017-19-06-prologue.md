Prologue
--------
I am Nathan Mahtava, founder of the Assembly. I am a 15 year old philosopher from Melbourne, Australia.
I am going to tell you a story.
This story will be narrated by two characters, the Writer and the wanderer.
This story is not a work of fiction, nor fact.
This story is not akin to a holy text like the Bible or Quran, but rather a device to catalyse the reader's develoment of their own understanding of that which cannot be understood.
This story is not to be taken literally, rather as a series of metaphors which amount to an allegory on a concept that cannot be conveyed through any other medium.
What this is I cannot tell you.

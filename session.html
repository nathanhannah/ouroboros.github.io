<p>I am Nathan Mahtava, founder of the Assembly. I am a 15 year old philosopher from Melbourne, Australia. I am going to tell you a story.</br>
This story will be narrated by two characters, the writer and the wanderer. This story is not a work of fiction, nor fact.</b>
The following text is not akin to the bible, rather a device to catalyse the reader to develop their own understanding of that which cannot be understood.</b>
What you will see before you is not a scripture, it is a metaphor representing a concept that cannot be conveyed through any other medium.</b>
Enjoy.</br>

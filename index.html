The Assembly is in session, join us now.
<br>
<br>
<br>
We are a nontheist religion, distinguised from traditional belief systems<br>
by our lack of belief in any entity of higher power. Though, that is not to say<br>
that we believe that there aren't any. We do not claim to know the<br>
word of god, but we, unlike atheists, are not arrogant enough to suggest<br>
that we know better than the religious, or that their gods are foolish.<br>
We understand that true understanding is unattainable, and so we simply<br>
speculate about the nature of principles beyond our comprehension.<br>
<br>
we are asking the questions without answers
<br>
To some, this may seem pointless. That is one of our main ideals.<br>
<br>
the only true knowledge after all is in knowing you know nothing<br>

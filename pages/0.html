<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>I am Nathan Mahtava, founder of the Assembly. I am a 15 year old philosopher from Melbourne, Australia.</br>
I am going to tell you a story.</br>
This story will be narrated by two characters, the Writer and the wanderer.</br>
This story is not a work of fiction, nor fact.</br>
This story is not akin to a holy text like the Bible or Quran, but rather a device to catalyse the reader's develoment of their own understanding of that which cannot be understood.</br>
This story is not a scripture, it is series of metaphors which amount to an allegory on a concept that cannot be conveyed through any other medium.</br>
What this is I cannot tell you.</br></p>
